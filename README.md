Script will add second contacts and group members from IT-sphere on Linkedin.
Project is not finished and temporary suspended.
You can change some options in "config.property file. I didn't create test user, you should use your own account.

Test will fail after sending approximately 120 invites or if user has added a restriction(linkedin ask his email).
It can be fixed if you write method which continue test from the next page. But I didn't do that because Linkedin can
block account. So if test fail, you should change variable "startFromThisPage" in "config.property" file on value
"failed page + 1"

PROFILE LANGUAGE MUST BE ENGLISH!!!
I DIDN'T USE THIS SCRIPT WITH SIMPLE PROFILE. Maybe it works. I TOOK PREMIUM ACCOUNT(1 free month, "recruiter light").
